Machine Learning Packages in Python

1)Numpy		=> Numeric array operations
				High performance data structure
				Vectarization algo to bypass loop iteration

2)Pandas		=> Pandas Dataframe
			=> Panel Sheet == Panel Data == Pandas


3)Scipy		=> Complex Statistical Calculations
4)Matplotlib	=> Data Visualization
5)Seaborn		=> Data Visualization




2)Pandas		=> Pandas Dataframe
			=> Panel Sheet == Panel Data == Pandas


	import pandas as pd

	# pandas datastructure 
		
		Series , Dataframe

	Series	=> Is a one-dimension array like object containing seq. of values and an associated array of data labels called its index

	Dataframe => Table of data and contains an ordered collection of columns
			=> dataframe has both a row and column index


None			unknown
NaN			unknown

There is no meaning to Null in python , its just a string 




Model Implementation Phase

						X1	X2	X3	X4
Input Data					Col1	Col2	Col3	Col4			2d numpy array

Output Data				ColVal					1d numpy array
						Y


Selecting Algorithm Linear Regression
Python package for its implementation

	from skleran.linear_model import LinearRegression

	regressor = LinearRegression()

	regressor.fit(___, ___)			# Passing data to machine for learning
								# fit() method accepst 2 para.	para1=> InputData	para2=>OutputData

								# para1 datatype 2d-numpy array as per fit() method defination
								# para2 datatype 1d-numpy array as per fit() method defination




Variation measures the spread or dispersion of values in a dataset 

Simple measure of variation is RANGE , the difference between the largest and smallest values 



dataset 		29		31		35		39		39		40		43		44		44		52

Time taken in minutes , to get ready for an individual 

range = 52-29 = 23  minutes 

Range 23 min indicates that the largest diff between any two days in the time to get ready is 23 min

Note** Being a simple measure of variation the range does nt consider how the values distribute or cluster between Extremes.


Experiment:: Tossing a Coin in a set of 3 tosses


Observations

			HHH			TTT
			HHT			TTH
			HTH			THT
			THH			HTT



Probability of getting heads P(X), X is number of heads

P(X=0)	=>		1/8
P(X=1)	=>		3/8
P(X=2)	=>		3/8
P(X=3)	=>		1/8



Types of Features

1)Discrete
2)Continuous


1)Discrete		

				YrOfBirth		2000		2001		2002		2003		2004


				Response		0		1

Yes response			prob(Yes)	= (observations==Yes)/TotalObservations
					probability distribution of discrete values caluclated using probability calculation




2)Continuous

				Exact weight of animal in the jungle

				1.55~5.67			10.76~50.66		80.12~99.999



				10kg			prob(10kg)	= (observations==10kg)/TotalObservations


					10.01	9.99		10.43

					probability distribution of continuous values calculated using PDF function
